Absolutely, liquidity is created by locking your NFT and issuing a bond against it. Once the bond is issued and funded, the NFT owner receives MRAY tokens, which serve as the liquidity. These MRAY tokens are pegged to the USDC reserve layer funded by the bond payment, ensuring their value is backed by real assets. This process allows NFT owners to unlock liquidity from their assets without having to sell them, providing both flexibility and financial freedom.`;
