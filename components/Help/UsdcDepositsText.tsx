USDC is deposited directly into the MRAY contract and locked for a vested period. In return, investors receive veMRAY tokens, which are vote-escrow tokens that can be used for governance decisions within the platform. The locked USDC forms the secure layer, which is then used to finance bonds when NFT owners issue them. Investors play a key role by choosing to back specific NFTs.
