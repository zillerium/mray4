Redeeming an NFT is simple and ensures the original owner gets their asset back. To redeem an NFT, the owner pays back the MRAY tokens that were issued when the NFT was locked. Once the MRAY tokens are returned, the NFT is unlocked and transferred back to its original owner. The yield in USDC is also paid, making the redemption complete. This process is seamless and ensures the NFT owner retains full control of their asset.
