Bond maturity is the point when a bondâ€™s lifecycle ends, and everything is settled. For our project, when a bond matures, the payment that was locked in the Treasury is returned to the bondholder along with the earned yield. At the same time, the NFT that was used as collateral is returned to its original owner, and the MRAY tokens that were issued when the NFT was locked are burned. This process ensures that everyone gets what they're entitled to, and the system resets for future transactions.
