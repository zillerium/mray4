Great question! In our project, a bond is a way to raise funds using NFTs. Think of it as a loan where you, the bondholder, lend money to an NFT owner. In return, you receive interest and the promise of repayment at a future date, known as the bondâ€™s maturity. Bonds tied to NFTs provide a way to unlock liquidity without having to sell the NFT outright, making them a powerful tool for creators and investors to generate cash flow while holding onto their valuable assets.
