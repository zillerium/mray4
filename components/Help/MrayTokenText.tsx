The MRAY token represents a share of the USDC reserves that are locked into the bond layer. When a bond is funded, the USDC is securely held in reserve and is never spent, ensuring the value of the MRAY token remains stable. This makes the MRAY token a type of stablecoin, pegged directly to the USDC reserves. It allows NFT owners and investors to transact confidently, knowing the token is backed by real, locked assets.`;
