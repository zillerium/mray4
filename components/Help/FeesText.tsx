It's a business, so we have fees to ensure we can continue providing NFT liquidity and returns to investors. The small fee is charged when issuing bonds, which helps cover the operational costs of the platform. Additionally, there is a fee applied when paying the yield to bondholders. These fees are designed to keep the system sustainable while ensuring a seamless experience for both NFT owners and investors.
