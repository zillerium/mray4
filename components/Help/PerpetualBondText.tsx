Yes, a perpetual bond is a type of financial instrument with no maturity date. In our project, this means the bond money remains locked, but the bond itself is tradable. This makes it a flexible investment, as bondholders can sell their position in secondary markets while continuing to earn yield. Because thereâ€™s no repayment of the principal, perpetual bonds share some similarities with equity, offering ongoing returns without a fixed end date.
