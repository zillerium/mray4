An NFT, or non-fungible token, is a unique digital certificate stored on the blockchain that represents ownership of a specific asset. Unlike cryptocurrencies, each NFT is one of a kind, making it perfect for tokenizing Real-World Assets (RWAs) like luxury cars, real estate, or rare collectibles. In our project, NFTs are used to digitally represent these valuable assets, making it easier to transfer, trade, or use them as collateral. By tying NFTs to RWAs, we create a secure and transparent way to unlock liquidity while maintaining a clear record of ownership.
